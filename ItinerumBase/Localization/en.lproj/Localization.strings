Its use is governed by the ethics guidelines of Concordia University.\n\nA.  PURPOSE\n\nThe purpose of this research project is to collect and analyse travel behaviour data of users on the transportation network with smartphones. Based on this data (origin and destination of trips, number of trips, transportation modes, etc.) we will be better able to predict mobility demand and plan the development of the transport network as a function of the needs of users.\n\nB.   PROCEDURES\n\nÂ·\n\nD.  CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nE. DECLARATION OF CONSENT\n\nBy pressing the button below, I confirm that I have attentively read and understood the above consent and the information presented, and I attest to the fact that my consent is informed, that all of my questions have been answered to my satisfaction and that I have had sufficient time to decide whether I want to participate in this study.

Itinerum MTL is an implementation of Itinerum, a travel survey application developed at Concordia University. By allowing the app to run in the background of your phone, you will share information on your trips for up to 30 days. The application will allow us to test and develop methods to better understand travel behaviour through the use of smartphones. Ultimately, your participation will help us improve transportation planning.\nIf you would like to report a technical problem, please send an email to:\nzachary.patterson@concordia.ca";
